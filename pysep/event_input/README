pysep event input files

The example files here should be for FINISHED projects, whereby another user might want to recreate published results.

For UAF seismologists, please store work-in-progress input files in the GEOTOOLS repository, at the following path:
GEOTOOLS/python_util/pysep_dev/

At the top of each event_input_XXXX.py file, please explain what the set of events is for.
