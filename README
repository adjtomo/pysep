THIS NEEDS TO BE OVERHAULED [AUG 2017]

This folder contains tools to request seismic data, process data, and write out sac files.
Our motivation is to have files prepared for moment tensor inversions in CAP.
However the sac files can be used for other purposes as well.

MAIN SCRIPT:
run_getwaveform.py

MAIN FUNCTIONS:
getwaveform_iris.py   -- to get data from IRIS
getwaveform_llnl.py   -- to get data from local LLNL database

For older instructions about using iris_tools.py see
