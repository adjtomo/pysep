==============================

This contains tools to request seismic data, process data, and write out sac files.
Our motivation is to have files prepared for moment tensor inversions.
However the sac files can be used for other purposes as well.

MAIN SCRIPTS:
run_getwaveform.py
event_input.py         -- source parameters for example events

MAIN FUNCTIONS:
getwaveform.py         -- to get data from IRIS/BK/LLNL databases

check_getwaveform.bash -- run example events and check the output files against pre-saved versions
                         
getwaveform_saved
   check_filenames     -- directory of list of files for example events in event_input.py
