What pyseis can do for you:
1. Input event information or get it from IRIS. You can also loop over multiple events.
2. extract waveforms using get_waveforms_bulk 
3. demean or detrend the waveforms (optional)
4. prefilter options (a) None (b) based on window length (c) input filter periods (optional)
5. filter extracted wavefroms (optional)
6. remove instrument response (optional)
7. Scale amplitude of the waveforms (optional)
8. Resample (optional)
9. Makes sure that ENZ waveforms for a stations are of equal length
10. Input taper fraction (optional; useful for short time-windows)
11. Add null traces so that there are always 3 components (optional; required when rotating)
12. Rotate to RTZ (optional)
13. Rotate to UVW triaxial orthogonal frame (optional)
14. Plots (spectrograms, instrument response, station map plot)
15. Save station .xml file 


Optional:
1. Use LLNL data (to extract data from LLNL database):
git clone https://github.com/krischer/llnl_db_client

==============================

This contains tools to request seismic data, process data, and write out sac files.
Our motivation is to have files prepared for moment tensor inversions.
However the sac files can be used for other purposes as well.

MAIN SCRIPTS:
run_getwaveform.py
event_input.py         -- source parameters for example events

MAIN FUNCTIONS:
getwaveform.py         -- to get data from IRIS/BK/LLNL databases

check_getwaveform.bash -- run example events and check the output files against pre-saved versions
                         
getwaveform_saved
   check_filenames     -- directory of list of files for example events in event_input.py
