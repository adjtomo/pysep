GEOTOOLS/python_util/util_data_syn/README

This folder contains tools to request seismic data, process data, and write out sac files.
Our motivation is to have files prepared for moment tensor inversions in CAP.
However the sac files can be used for other purposes as well.

MAIN SCRIPTS:
run_getwaveform.py
event_input.py        -- source parameters for example events

MAIN FUNCTIONS:
getwaveform_iris.py   -- to get data from IRIS
getwaveform_llnl.py   -- to get data from local LLNL database

check_getwaveform     -- run example events and check the output files against a pre-saved version in
                         
getwaveform_saved
   check_filenames    -- directory of list of files for example events in event_input.py
