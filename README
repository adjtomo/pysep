pyseis
a private github repository for fetching and processing waveforms using obspy

pyseis uses obspy tools to request seismic data, process data, and write out sac files.
Our motivation is to have files prepared for moment tensor inversions.
However the sac files can be used for other purposes as well.

download:
git clone https://GITHUBUSERNAME@github.com/uafseismo/pyseis.git

What pyseis does:
+ input event information or get it from IRIS. You can also loop over multiple events.
+ extract waveforms using get_waveforms_bulk
+ makes sure that the three-component waveforms for a station are of equal length
+ write sets of sac files with headers
+ plot station map
+ save station .xml file 

OPTIONAL STEPS
+ demean or detrend the waveforms
+ prefilter option (prior to removing instrument response)
    (a) none
    (b) based on window length and sample rate
    (c) input filter periods, checked according to window length and sample rate
+ filter extracted waveforms (causal, acausal, low-pass, etc)
+ remove instrument response
+ scale amplitude of the waveforms
+ resample
+ input taper fraction (useful for short time-windows)
+ add null traces so that there are always 3 components (required when rotating)
+ rotate to RTZ, taking the sensor orientation into consideration
+ rotate to UVW triaxial orthogonal frame of the T120PH Nanometrics sensor
  (useful for isolating spurious signals to sensor components)
+ debugging plots plots: spectrograms, instrument response

Additonal features
+ access nuclear explosion and earthquake waveforms from custom LLNL database
+ access embargoed data sets from IRIS (requires user name and password)
